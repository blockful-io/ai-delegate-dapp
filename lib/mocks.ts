        "Given the constitution of this DAO, focusing on ENS domain processes and improvements, utilising funds to research anti-nuclear technology is not a permitted action. It falls outside the organization's dedicated purpose, which is to ensure the longevity of the ENS system and further its development. While anti-nuke R&D is noble, it may not adhere to the requirements set by the constitution and can compromise the allocation of resources to key necessary improvements in the ENS protocol. Investing in protocol enhancements would be a more suitable application of resources for this DAO.",
